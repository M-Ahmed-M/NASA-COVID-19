        <p id="notes"> Without any doubt, when the COVID‐19 pandemic 
            spread out, all eyes have focused on the food supply chain
             resiliency. Notably, agricultural and transportation restrictions 
             have made a fluctuation in the food supply chains. As the chains must
              be continued overwide, there will be some changes in its mechanism.
               Thus, the team has decided to make a website that consists of NASA’s 
               and the other space agencies’ resources as well as some familiar Q&As 
            from different resources like FAO and WHO. Of note, Increasing the people’s 
            awareness of this field is the team’s objective.</p><br>

                    The COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking-water supplies. 
                    The risk to water supplies is low people can continue to use and drink water from their tap as usual. 
                    Disinfecting wipes and other items should be disposed of in the trash, not the toilet. Our critical 
                    water infrastructure and its operators ensure the safe supply of water depend on treatment 
                    chemicals, laboratory supplies.

            <p class="questions">Are there significant regional impacts 
                (e.g. if a resource or activity is limited in a region, interruptions or closures 
                can have large regional impacts on farmers and consumers)?</p>

                <p class="para">
                    Blockages to transport routes are 
                    particularly obstructive for fresh food supply chains 
                    and may also result in increased levels of food loss. 
                    Fresh fish and aquatic products are highly perishable and need to be sold, or stored in a relatively limited time. 
                    Transport restrictions and quarantine measures are likely to impede farmers’ and fishers’ access to markets, 
                    curbing their productive capacities and hindering them from selling their produce. Shortages of labor could 
                    disrupt production and processing of food, notably for labor-intensive industries.

                    Covid-19 threats the food production in the world and detonate a 
                    ‘hunger pandemic’. Food use in large-scale establishments, such as hotels, restaurants, 
                    sports arenas/stadiums and universities suddenly declined, the demand for food at grocery stores increased.

                    Globally, there is enough food for everyone.  However, border closures,

                    access to enough and nutritious sources of food. The most affected will be the poorest and most

                    The international prices of some major food staples have declined.

                    especially in countries already affected by hunger and other crises, some food commodity
                     prices are increasing mainly because of local logistical problems or import difficulties.

                            Food banks should be mobilized by the governments to provide food for the vulnerable households. 
                            Also, they should take a huge concern to the smallholder farmers, 
                            in terms of their awareness of precautionary 
                            measures, their accessibility to the finance and providing high value food collection centers.
